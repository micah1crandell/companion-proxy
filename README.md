# Companion Proxy

## Overview
Companion Proxy is a command-line utility and HTTP server that allows you to create, manage, and trigger HTTP actions. It provides a simple way to interact with remote APIs using configurable actions, which can be added, edited, deleted, or triggered via the command line or a web interface.

## Features
- Start a local HTTP server to manage actions.
- Add, edit, delete, and list HTTP actions.
- Trigger actions via CLI or HTTP API.
- Store logs of executed actions.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Quick Start

### Run Without Building a Binary
To quickly start the server without building a binary, run:

```sh
 go run main.go server -port=8080
```

This will start the HTTP server on port `8080`. You can specify a different port if needed.

---

### Build and Run as a Binary
If you prefer to build and run Companion Proxy as a standalone binary, follow these steps:

1. Build the binary:
   ```sh
   go build -o companion-proxy main.go
   ```
2. Run the binary:
   ```sh
   ./companion-proxy server -port=8080
   ```

Now you can use the CLI to interact with the server:

```sh
./companion-proxy add -name "MyAction" -url "http://example.com/api" -method POST
```

---

### Install Binary for System-Wide Use
If you want to run `companion-proxy` from any directory without specifying `./` or the full path, move the binary into a directory included in your systemâ€™s `PATH`:

```sh
mv companion-proxy /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you can run commands globally, such as:

```sh
companion-proxy server -port=8080
```
